# Eat & Love & Repeat

## Project Description

Eat & Love & Repeat is an interactive and dynamic e-commerce application built with React, designed specifically for the restaurant industry. It aims to enhance the dining experience by allowing customers to easily browse the menu, view detailed information about each dish, and manage their orders seamlessly. The app combines user-friendly navigation, rich product details, and seamless shopping cart functionality to create a delightful online dining experience.

   Users can submit ratings and comments for each dish, contributing to a community-driven review system that helps other customers decide on their meals.

6. **Key Metrics Tracking:**
